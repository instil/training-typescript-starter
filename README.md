# TypeScript Starter

The simplest sensible starter for TypeScript.

Includes npm scripts for building and running, development mode and tests.

* `npm run app` - compiles and runs the compiled output
* `npm run dev` - runs using ts-node in a nodemon watcher, restarts on file changes
* `nom run test` - runs the jest tests in watch mode

This app assumes the entry point is app.ts in src/ (or app.js in dist/) if compiled.

It uses es modules rather than common js.
